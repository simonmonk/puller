Laser design files for an anti-touching tool to help with hygienic opening and closing of doors etc. 

![GUI Example](http://)

This multipurpose tool is a response to the need for hygenic social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic. It allows you to open and close doors, unlatch gates and press buttons without having to touch anything that may have surface contamination of droplets containing the virus.

If you cut it from acrylic, then you can wash it at the start of your hand-washing regime.

# How to Use

# Cutting

I cut the tool using 3mm acrylic which is strong enough, but 4mm or more would be better. I also cut a plywood version, which provided better grip, but I amagine would be much harder to sterilize.

Its quick to cut and only needs material of 160 x 120 mm

My K40 laser cutter is controlled using the excellent k40 Whisperer https://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html. This requires files for cutting to be in SVG format with the lines to be vector cut to be in red.
